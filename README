This repository contains the source code for a very simple packer for elf binaries, somewhat similar to other projects like UPX. 
In it's current state, each byte of the payload will be XORed.
This project is, in its current state, only a proof of concept and as such should not be used to protect anything important.

To compile stub:
    make stub

To compile packer:
    make packer

To pack:
    ./packer payload output
